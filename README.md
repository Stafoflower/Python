# Python Book
## About
This contains different solutions even including Brian's [<Practicle Introduction To Python>](https://www.brianheinold.net/python/python_book.html)! But mostly about my daily own projects I made and used the repo to post. My Replit account is @Muggsy.

I am still adding items to this book. This will be at least 100MB book! A big book!
